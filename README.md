## 🌀 What This Is

A visual and mathematical demonstration of the **Breathing Multiverse Theory**, a cosmological model proposing that universes expand and contract in rhythmic cycles, producing effects observable as:

- Dark matter density fluctuations
- CMB anisotropies
- Low-frequency gravitational wave signatures (e.g., NANOGrav)

---

## 📊 Features

- ✅ Interactive breathing universe simulator with sliders (amplitude & frequency)
- 🧩 Dark matter density mapping (coming soon)
- 🌌 CMB breathing distortions (in progress)
- 🛠️ Built with Python + Jupyter Notebook
